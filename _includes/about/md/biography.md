A Graphics Programmer, Musician, Language Learner and more living in the UK. I love to understand how things work - be it
computers, physics or even other cultures! Right now I've directed my focus on computer graphics, and aim to understand
how computers are able to efficiently produce the beautiful scenes we see in video games in real time. Outside of my
graphics exploration I spend my time acting like a human. I'd love to go and visit Japan one day and I've been
learning the language as I find the culture so interesting and unique compared to what I'm used to. And also if you catch me
on the right day, you might find me sitting in a lab coat, cackling madly as I plot to take over the world.

<!-- Computers are one of the greatest inventions of the modern era and have completely changed how we live our lives. But they're
also incredibly complex, incredibly flexible and incredibly useful. I'm really interested in how things work in general, but
computers are the thing I chose to really take time to understand. Digging even deeper, I chose specifically computer graphics.
Computer games are amazing, but to me the most amazing part is how they're able to create a whole world in a screen, and how
connected it is to the physics that make light work in the real world. But the love for how other things work has never left.
