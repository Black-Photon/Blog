## Chapter 1: Early Days

Alam woke suddenly. He sat up, briefly surveilling the room. A pile of junk and old toys sat in the corner menacingly. His toy plasma rifle sat on a wall across the room. Next to him, the wall lit up in response to his waking. The clock read ‘2:23’. A bit early, but better early than late. It also showed a raincloud, indicating it was raining. Not surprising south of the marsh, but annoying. Rain seemed to be common around the summer changing, and despite the cold, he longed for winter. At least the snow was fun, and the schools sometimes had to close. Alam moved his hand over the wall, bringing up any messages. The only two were the school, giving a reminder of the trip today, and Tessie, who woke up 30 minutes ago and was bored. As school didn’t start for another 57 minutes, he thought he might as well go and see her. He told the wall she should expect him as he got changed. Another message told him she received it as he left the room.

“You’re up early” his mother greeted him as he stepped into the room. “Excited about today?” Truthfully, he was a bit. He’d heard so much about Almac, and was interested to find out if it really was as good as everyone thinks. And either way, it couldn’t be worse than another lecture on ‘The Great War’.

“Nah, just not tired” he replied.

“Ok, well if you’re going out, remember to get to school on time. If there’s any day to arrive on time, it’s today.” She was always reminding him to get there on time, but he always got too caught up talking to Tessie to check the time.

“Alright” he responded, before walking out the port-door. The energy from it tingled as he walked through. Outside, the sky was a dark blue, fading into orange. He never understood some people’s fascination with the sunrise. They sat for entire sects, just waiting for the sun to come up, to take the perfect photo. During the summer, the sun gets too bright to look at and in the winter it’s too small for a good photo. But during the changings, twice a year, it’s just right. Along the road sat a cascade of white houses, though soon they’d turn black for winter. Above this sat a large black cloud. It seemed to have chosen this spot to stay and refused to move, though they were used to rain. It always ended up draining to the marsh anyway. Fortunately, someone worked out a while back that you could repel rain by charging clothes positively. It wasn’t quite enough to hold off a downpour, but light rain like this was no problem. Underneath the rising sun, beyond the cloud, was the Fort. Nobody knew why, but they kept it manned even now in case of invasion – despite there being nobody likely to invade.

Alam took a step onto his Magpod, and sped down the road. After a number of seconds, he stepped off the board, finding himself before Tessie’s house. He slid the board into the Magpod bay as he jumped off easily. Without wasting a movement, he confidently walked towards the house. He crashed straight into the port-door, and as he recovered he could hear alarms begin to ring. Tessie was visible through the door tapping on a panel on the inside, before saying “Try it now”. He complied, walking more cautiously but eager to escape the rain, whether he crashed or not. This time, however, he passed through the port-door and the sound of rain subsided.

“Thanks” he said, starting to wonder why the door blocked him.

“Sorry” she replied, “My Dad’s getting his turn to be examined soon, so he needs to make sure they don’t find anything. That includes resetting the door configuration every week.” Alam remembered when his Dad was examined – they’d needed to do something similar. It was unlikely the Establishment would make something of it, but it was better to be safe. While usually nobody bothers to reset the door config from convenience and nobody ever made a problem of it, it was still technically a law. “Come on” she instructed, while motioning for him to follow. He did so, following her to the bedroom.

Compared to his, it was a mess. Items were strewn around everywhere, and a thin crack extended down the computer interface wall. Alam could recall helping her make that crack, when she’d had an idea for a set of noise dampers. It took a week to get they’re hearing completely back.

“Welcome” she grandly proclaimed “to my humble ab… ouch!” Alam was quick to send a nearby soft toy at her, interrupting the speech. “Hey! Why’d you do that?” she asked in mock anger.

“If you didn’t act as if I were the president every time every time I entered the room I wouldn’t need to” He quickly responded, exasperated.

“But I thought you’d want to be treated such”

“If you want to give me a million Arlans, I certainly won’t refuse them.”

“It’s not about the money, it’s the life! The treatment, the relaxation.” Alam walked over and sat on the bed.

“So…” he began, “the trip today?”

“I’m looking forward to it.” Alam was shocked. They’d been on a hundred trips before – to Dean, the Marsh, the Fort and even once the capital – Gronn. But every time, Tessie was the first to exclaim how boring villages are, how wet the marsh is, how obsolete the fort is and how segregated the Capital is. It was difficult to conceive of a trip she actually wanted to go on.

“You’re… looking forward to it?” he managed.

“Well… yeah. I mean most places are more boring than Mr Bori’s lectures, but I’ve got a cousin in Almac, and what he’s said sounds pretty good.” Now Alam had a source of information he listened eagerly.

“And what has he said?”

“Please?” Alam sighed.

“Fine, please.” There was a moment of silence.

“Alright. Imagine Vaghr. Now make all the buildings towers of white and bright colours. Basically an art piece. Now, everyone you see is friendly. You can get anywhere super easy. Magpods, Zimps, Holograms, terminals everywhere. I swear they even made a building that floats recently. Think of anything and you’ll probably get it there.”

“Telepathic communication”

“Ok you got me. Almost anything.”

“Fine, that’s pretty cool, but is that it?”

“Would a dedicated magpod track impress you?”

“Would it!” In Vaghr they’d been limited where they could ride Magpods by a lack of interesting obstacles. The only place worth using them was the school obstacle course, where Magpods were promptly banned.

“Do you think they’ll let us take ours?” he asked. A chance to go on the course would be amazing.

“I doubt it” she responded. Alam felt his excitement begin to drain away. “Though if we had something much more harmless, like a Compad for taking notes, they might” As if struck by lightning his anticipation returned.

“You bought a retractable pod?”

“I may have” Alam could have kissed her – this would be amazing.

“Ok, I concede – Now I’m excited”

“Just one condition”

“Anything” he answered eagerly

“We don’t spend ALL the time there. So we actually go out and see the city.”

“Done. Now can I see it?” Tessie shook her head in exasperation. Alam knew he was overreacting but didn’t really care – He’d spent way too much time on flat roads. A bit of variety would be fun. Tessie turned and fumbled through the piles, until finally moving back up, this time with a bag. She opened the bag, taking out 2 Compads.

“You want to do extra homework before we go?” Alam took one and opened it. However, unlike a Compad, a screen did not greet him. Instead it seemed to still be folded in on itself. After opening further, it finally revealed itself to be a long thin board, and all the hinges seemed to just vanish.

“Wow… How on Eln did you get this?” Every time they’d been to the shopping spheres, they looked at the Magpods, but they’d never seen anything like this.

“When I said they have everything in Almac, I wasn’t exaggerating. You’d be amazed at the things they have there. I called my cousin, gave him the money and he got them.” Alam was beginning to be truly interested in the city now. Who knows what else they might have there.

“Want to take them out for a ride?” She asked him.

“Sure!” he was quick to respond, but then hesitated. “What about the rain?” Tessie pointed to the black wall, showing a picture of a cloud, but no rain beneath.

“No longer a problem.” Without wasting a second, Alam jumped down and ran outside, Tessie following behind. As soon as he got through the port door, he threw down the board, simultaneously jumping onto where it’d be, landing gracefully on it, while Tessie did the same – adding some extra spin as well when throwing the board. After a quick glance back, he leaned onto his front foot and was off.

Compared to his normal Magpod it was slightly less smooth, but considering how thin it was in comparison, it was amazing to be that good. Being on the pod always made him feel free. He sped through the air, disconnected from reality. A bird, escaping all pressure of life. Another bird drew up from behind him until they were side by side. Hours flew by at the speed of light. He saw his nest for the briefest second he was sure, they must’ve passed by it. A path winded around the town for them to follow. The path was their air currents – what kept them flying. At one point, they passed a large span of grass, leading up to a set of domes they knew to be the shopping spheres. They circled the area for a time, before returning to the road. More plains awaited them, but it was no concern. They could continue forever. As they passed, structures grew before vanishing. The dull power station, Town Hall, Enforcers and an array of colourful buildings that were even more shops. Then they reached the Fort, the dull stone bricks boring into them. The unyielding walls and threatening arrow holes brought them quickly to a stop. A silence fell over them at that moment. Tessie finally broke the silence.

“That place still brings me the creeps.” Alam completely agreed. The fact people still patrolled the walls made it seem even worse. As if an army of ghosts lay in wait for whoever dared enter.

“Come on, let’s get back home.” The rest of the journey was much more pleasant. The ground glistened in the light as they passed, the water reflecting the grey sky. They returned to Tessie’s house, careful to refold the Magpods to their disguised state and collapsed onto the bed.

“Maybe not as good as an actual Magpod course, but that never gets old.” Tessie managed. “I’d happily ride to Almac on a Magpod.”

“It’s a few days, but if not for the patrols, I’d actually consider it.” The patrols were careful to make sure nobody left Vaghr without ID. They’d tried before, but their Magpods were always faster.

“Hey!” Tessie suddenly exclaimed “Do you have money saved up?” Alam cursed mentally. He hadn’t considered buying anything in Almac, but now it seemed obvious.

“Damn” he blurted.

“Well I suppose you’ll need to borrow mine” Alam wondered why he was surprised. She always managed to come up with something to solve the problems he didn’t even know he had.

“Wow… thanks. How much more do you plan to give me?” he jokingly asked.

“It’s a loan dummy. I expect it all back with interest.”

“How about 0%?”

“Done.” Alam sat back in relief, casually glancing at the clock. It read “2:85” He froze.

“Hey? Alam? What’s up?” She turned to look too just as Alam recovered.

“We’re late!” He exclaimed while pulling at Tessie. For a moment she was as he was, but quickly got under control, grabbing the money and boards and left. They took their normal magpods as they sped around to the school. They swiftly parked them and ran up to the Zimp bay. One was just leaving, but two more were moving out towards the opening. They had a shape like a 3D oval, and while they once were smooth and white, years of service had left it’s mark on them, and scratches and dirt was visible. The Zimps move elegantly, floating along at a constant slow speed. They hopped into one just as it was leaving.

“Alam, Tessie, late as usual” a teacher said as they stood heaving.

“Sorry” Tessie responded “we lost track of time.” The teacher made a ‘Hmph’ sound as they sat on the front chairs – the ones everyone avoids from their distance to the teacher – this time Mr Wynd. Out of all the teachers, he wasn’t the worst. He didn’t take nonsense, but as least made an effort to make lessons interesting.

“Now I’m only going to say this once, so listen up” he proclaimed “When we get there, you will leave in a line. Every 6 people was get their own link-pod. You can choose the groups or go with anyone – I don’t care. Just tell someone if you can’t get the right size group. Once we arrive in Erith, there will be a teacher waiting outside the link hub. Follow them, and gather there. We’ll count you all and then let you go wherever. In short, be sensible.” He finished and sat down across from Tessie and Alam. Quickly the Zimp was overtaken by conversation.

“Well I suppose we didn’t need the special magpods after all” Tessie mentioned, careful not to let Mr Wynd hear, but Alam was stuck to the window. “Hey, you alright?”

“Yeah, I’m fine” he replied, distracted, “Only I’ve never seen the city from above before.” It was more spectacular than he expected. To the south he could see the fort, half the sun peering over. It suddenly seemed more an ancient monument than simply a haunted castle. Its features were defined in contrast to the sunbeams eminating around its shadow. As his eyes wandered along, they came across rows of houses, parallel to the school. Even the corner shops were visible. As they passed, everything seemed so small compared to seeing them on the Magpod earlier. The power station the size of a compad. The spheres more like Turri balls. But the ammo factories still looked just like bricks. Large dirty bricks. Eventually they approached a sphere even larger than the shopping spheres, with an intricate webbing of hexagons along its surface. Unlike most buildings, it was completely spotless – as clean as it would be if only just finished. The Zimp decended, landing in front of the large dome, last of the three vehicles. They all got out, following Mr Wynds instructions for a straight line. Alam and Tessie made sure to be the last to leave.

“Hey” Tessie said as she nudged Alam.

“Yeah?” He responded.

“What do you think the link is like? I heard one person say nobody comes out alive.”

“I don’t think it would be quite that dramatic.”

“How do you know?”

“Well wouldn’t somebody notice if we all suddenly vanished?”

“Unless we became robots.” At that Alam turned to look at her.

“Robots? Really?” Tessie shrugged and they continued. They quickly came to the security checkpoint. Almost immediately they were asked to remove their packs. They did so and the packs were scanned for a few seconds before being allowed to continue. A sign was nearby showingthe things not allowed in the personal belongings section. Magpods were on the list. It was this point they were glad for taking the precaution. The next step was the ticket machine, and they began heading there as soon as they were both checked.

“You know, we could have gotten a transport cart for the Magpods.” Alam mentioned.

“Yeah, but then the school would have noticed. They seemed to be quite adament about it in the breifing.” Tessie reasoned, Alam nodding in response.

“It still would’ve been nice to bring the full ones.” he complained, but didn’t continue. They reached the ticket machine where, after giving their and their teachers ID’s, presented a screen to choose their destination. It was a map of Almac and Durrhein, each link hub glowing brightly. They pressed on the Almacian capital, Erith, and took the received tokens.

“How do these work?” Questioned Alam.

“I suppose we’re about to find out”. In front of them was a pod. It was white, circular and had an open top. Seats lined the edge, and in the centre sat a table. They cautiously stepped into the pod, where two others were already sat. Mr Wynd followed behind them. When they were all in, a ceiling appeared from the walls of the pod, seeming to slide up out of nowhere. The parts eventually met at the top, and closed them in.

“You know, it’s smaller than I expected” Tessie said.

“I did expect something more grand” Alam admitted. Around them, green lights appeared behind their heads, and the computer suddenly spoke.

“Welcome to the link. We will be departing to Erith shortly.”, Suddenly, the table became a timer, counting down as the circle that made up the table shrank down. After 10 seconds, it was now a semicircle.

“What do you think will happen” Alam asked.

“I honestly don’t know.” The light suddenly turned blue as the countdown finished, and for an instant, Alam felt almost like he was falling, but it went so quickly after, he wondered if it was imagined. The blue light only stayed for 5 or so seconds before it became white again. Everyone except Mr Wynd looked around in confusion.

“Why did we stop?” One of the two opposite asked. Mr Wynd only smiled. All of a sudden, the roof came down and they stepped out of the pod. Tessie looked to Alam in confusion, but Alam was just as confused. They walked out towards the exit, wondering what could have caused the pod not to go. They walked out to the exit, passing the tickets area and Durrhein security. Everything seemed slightly off from before. As they finally exited, they saw it. A magnificent sight right before their eyes.

Erith.
