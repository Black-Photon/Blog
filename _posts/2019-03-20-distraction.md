I’ve recently thought, you could be in a fight to the death, but if the world is suddenly about to explode, they’d work together to stop it.

<!--more-->

For any argument, disagreement or anything really, there will be something bigger which will make them work together to fix it.

WWII for example, Russia and the Alliance worked together despite tensions to fight Germany.

What it is, however, that does it is a harder question, and depends on the person. Take another example:

Imagine you were planning to run over someones house. and then 3 events happen:

1. Said person tells you to stop
2. That same person lies in front of the bulldozer
3. An alien species comes to demolish the Earth

Most people would ignore the first. Something as simple as that won’t stop you. The second, however, might make you think twice. If you continue, you may be responsible for loss of human life. That is an event big enough to stop you. If it doesn’t, the last is certain to stop essentially everyone. They ignore the problem to face an even bigger one.

In the same way, people can be most close when fighting for freedom, as that outweighs essentially everything in their lives. As soon as they achieve it, they can fall apart as there is now room for small problems to exist.

And also, ruling by fear uses a common principal – that fear outweighing most other problems.

When a problem first occurs, it has much more power than later down the line. Two countries may stop a war when they notice the world will end in 50 years, but as time goes by, it seems less important and they may begin a similar war 5 years later.

The thing about all this is it happens when somebody is distracted from what they’re doing to a more immediate threat. And for everything, there will be a more immediate threat.
