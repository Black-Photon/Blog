“And that’s why Rust is such an improvement over C” he finishes. I quickly get my bearing, nodding.

“Yes of course C is more widely used, but lacks functions on a structure basis. Though that is resolved by C++”. He seems to agree. Soon we come across an Ice Cream stall. “Hey, that looks nice.”

“Hey! How you both doing?” the new one asked.

“Yeah, good. This Ice Cream is nice” I responded.

“This is a nice cafe!” the new one mentioned.

“I agree” I said, thinking how to elaborate. “Have I mentioned the story of my favorite coffee?” They shook their heads. “Well, basically I kept ending up in Costa a lot. This is because, well, somebody liked coffee a lot, and we often ended up going there often, so I needed to made a decision. Now most coffee was too strong for me, so I wanted something weaker, like a Latte. Also I noticed vanilla and it worked really well together, So that’s it.”

I soon started stirring the coffee, and looked into it, wondering what would happen if every atom was a small planet. Though they would make funny planets, repelling each other rather than attracting.
