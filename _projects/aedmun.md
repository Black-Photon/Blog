While working on jOSeph, I inexplicably created a very basic clicker game. Once it was finished, I thought it would be fun to make an *actual* clicker game. So I looked up how to make games in Java, found LibGDX and started working. From my understanding of Java at the time, I decided on 3 main classes - Data, Mechanics and Graphics, each focusing on a specific area. In addition, I used other classes to represent objects. The graphics was one of the harder bits, as everything had to be scaled to an unknown screen size, and there was no graphical interface of helper align functions.

However, I believe it turned out well, also including a tutorial to help you get started. You can see it here:

The concept is you need to get enough food and building for the population. If you have enough, it increases. This costs resources you can also get by clicking. Buildings are restricted by era, which you can increase by getting a monument. The final game runs on Desktop or android, and is available on my GitHub [here](https://github.com/Black-Photon/Aedmun)
